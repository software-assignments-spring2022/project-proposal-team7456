# Project Proposal

## Project title
Attendance Software for Enterprise

## What and why?
This attendance software is programmed for storing and processing the attendance related data, which includes the punch in time and punch out time of each employee. It is worth buliding as it can build a particular and exact attendance-status statistical report for the company which is effective for enterprise human resource management.

## For whom?
For big corporations with hundreds or thousands of staffs, it is necessary for the manager to have a software to record daily attendance situation of all employees.

## How?
Every staff will register for an account which includes user name and password. With an account, they can log in on their work computers when they arrive at their company and before they leave the company to punch in and punch out. The software will record the real-time of their operations. All data will be saved in a database.

## Scope
This project includes the implementation of authentication (register and log in), the application of data platform and some client side javascript. It might need some time to work on but is not out of scope.
